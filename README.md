CodeEd Quiz App
===============

Learn to build a simple photo quiz app. We will use:

- [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap] to help us get our prototype looking good fast.
- [jQuery][jquery] so we can easily change our page with JS.
- [The flickr API][flickr] to load photos based on a certain keyword.
- [HTML5 localStorage][localstore] to save quiz scores on the user's computer.

[jquery]: http://jquery.com/ "jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library."
[flickr]: http://www.flickr.com/services/api/ "The flickr API lets us access content on flickr from our code."
[localstore]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage#sessionStorage "localStorage lets us save data on the user's computer to be accessed later."
